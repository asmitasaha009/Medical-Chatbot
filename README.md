# Medical-Chatbot
Created a chatbot application using FastAPI for the backend and Streamlit for the frontend to enable easy retrieval of patient medical records from a MySQL database.

Allowed users to search patient data through natural language queries.

Integrated fuzzy string matching to handle spelling errors and enhance search accuracy.

Developed dynamic SQL queries to extract and present relevant patient test results and medical conditions.

Architected the system for future expansion into a full-featured hospital management platform, including functionalities like bed availability tracking and billing management.
